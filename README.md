# pdf_page_export
A tool for reading PDFs and creating exports of specified page ranges by [Anthony Moser](http://www.github.com/anthonymoser) 

1.  Upload a file; choose "Show PDF" to preview in the browser, or open the file on your computer, if the browser is being slow  
2.  Choose the name for your first file export
3. Choose the pages, which can be a range, a list of comma separated pages, or both (e.g.  1-5,8,12-15)
4. Click "Add export"
5. Repeat until you have entered all the files and pages you want to export
6. Click "Export PDFs"
7. The site will generate a .zip file containing your exported PDFs, along with any embedded files


NOTES:   
This works nicely on smaller PDFs. If the site is being slow,  uncheck "Show PDF" and look at the document locally. 
You can still upload, enter the page ranges, and export without the in-browser preview.  
  
Once you've added an export, you can't delete it, but if you "Add Export" for the same name and a different page list, 
it will update the existing export.
